# Coding-Blog
First full stack App I built.  This app uses the standard trio of Javascript, HTML, and CSS for the front end.  
On the back end I used Node JS with a MongoDB Database, hosted on MLAB, and it is deployed on Heroku.   

#Why I Built This App
I wanted a blog website that I could manage entirely from my browser. Once logged in using local authentication, the user of this app can completely manage
the entries entirely from their browser.  Previous blog apps I have made, I would I have to update the blog post in my text editor then upload the blog
upload it to a webserver on the back end.  

# Free App for anyone to use
